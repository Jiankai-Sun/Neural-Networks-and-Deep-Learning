# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning
Code for Nielsen book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning". The online book can be find [here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)

The [original code samples](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) is written for Python 2.6 or 2.7. Michal Daniel Dobrzanski has a repository for Python 3 [here](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35).

## Requirement:
Python >= 3.6.1  
IPython >= 6.0.0

## Note:
1. network2.py probably dosn't work currectly. For more details, check test2.ipynb.


2. Untested    
  fig/more_data.py: Probably not correct. 
  fig/multiple_eta.py    
  fig/overfitting.py    
  fig/weight_initialization.py
